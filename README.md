## Abstract

> Momentum Investing is an investment strategy that involves buying securities that have had strong recent price performance and selling those that have had weak performance. The idea behind this strategy is that securities that have recently performed well are likely to continue to do so, while those that have performed poorly are likely to continue to underperform. This strategy is based on the concept of momentum, which is the tendency of an asset's price to continue moving in the same direction it has been moving in the recent past.
